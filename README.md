Automaton refers to "automation", denoting automatic processes carrying out the production of 
specific processes. The automata theory deals with the logic of computation with respect to simple 
machines, known as automata. Through automata, computer scientists are able to understand how 
machines compute functions and solve problems and more importantly, what it means for a 
function to be defined as computable or for a question to be described as decidable .
These automatons are abstract models of machines that perform computations on an input by 
moving through a series of states or configurations. At each state of the computation, a transition 
function determines the next configuration on the basis of a finite portion of the present 
configuration. As a result, once the computation reaches an accepting configuration, it accepts that 
input. As a whole, automata theory is used to develop methods by which computer scientists can 
describe and analyze the dynamic behavior of discrete systems, in which signals are sampled 
periodically. In this project we have implemented a lexical analyzer using finite automaton, which 
performs lexical analysis that is the first phase of the compiler and converts a high level input 
program into a sequence of tokens.
